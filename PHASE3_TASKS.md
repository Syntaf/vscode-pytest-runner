## Implementation Strategy - LIGHTWEIGHT FOCUS

### 🎯 **Phase 3 Principles:**
1. **NO heavy operations** - no test collection, no slow parsing
2. **Optimize existing features** - make current functionality faster
3. **Polish over features** - make existing experience great
4. **Fast startup** - extension should activate quickly
5. **Minimal memory** - efficient resource usage

### 🔄 **Recommended Order:**
1. **Performance optimizations** (3.1) - immediate user impact
2. **Error handling improvements** (3.2) - better reliability  
3. **Configuration polish** (3.3) - essential functionality
4. **Documentation** (3.5) - user enablement
5. **Stability improvements** (3.6) - long-term reliability
6. **CodeLens polish** (3.4) - visible improvements
7. **Quality of life features** (3.7) - final polish

### ⚠️ **What We're EXPLICITLY NOT Doing:**
- ❌ Heavy test collection operations (`pytest --collect-only`)
- ❌ Complex background processing or workers
- ❌ **VS Code Test Explorer API integration** (adds complexity and weight)
- ❌ Advanced plugin systems or heavy integrations
- ❌ Complex caching mechanisms or databases
- ❌ Heavy third-party integrations
- ❌ Any feature that slows down extension startup or operation
